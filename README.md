## üöÄ Features


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up the Project locally
### Prerequisites
#### Node.js should be installed on your system
#### An account on IPFS and PinataSDK
#### Either MongoDB should be available on your local or make a account in MongoAtlas to use it without dowloading
#### Account on Cloudinary for saving uploaded files
#### Should have a crypto wallet(like Metamask) with some sepolia in it
#### An ESP32 microcontroller setup connected to a computer for running the Arduino code
#### An Account in the HiveMQ-A MQTT Broker Cloud
#### Arduino IDE installed on the computer with which the ESP32 microcontroller will be connected using MicroUSB cable
#### A free account on Redis Cloud
#### <ul><li>[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)</li><li>[MetaMask extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/metamask/ejbalbakoplchlghecdalmeeeajnimhm)</li><li>[MongoDB(local)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)</li><li>[MongoAtlas(Cloud)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkXvVOb99g0)</li><li>[IPFS](https://merrillinsurance.ipfs.com/)</li><li>[PinataSDK](https://pinata.cloud/)</li><li>[HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt/public-mqtt-broker/)</li><li>[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/users/login)</li></ul>

### Setting up the frontend
```
cd app/client
npm install
```
### Setting up the backend
```
cd app/server
npm install
```

### üé™ Setting up .env Variables

#### First we need to configure a .env file for secret variables used in the sever side of this project

#### You need to add following variables in your .env file in the server folder:
```
PORT= " the port where your server-side express application will run"
URL= "URL of the client side website"

PINATA_API_KEY= " received from the official website of Pinata "
PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY= " received from the official website of Pinata "
GATEWAY_URL= " received from the official website of Pinata "
PINATA_JWT= " received from the official website of Pinata "

MQTT_BROKER_HOSTNAME= " received from the official website of HiveMQ "
MQTT_BROKER_PORT= " received from the official website of HiveMQ "
MQTT_BROKER_USERNAME= " received from the official website of HiveMQ "
MQTT_BROKER_PASSWORD= " received from the official website of HiveMQ "

EMAIL_ADDRESS= "a outlook email address for sending emails"
EMAIL_PASSWORD= "password of that account"

MONGODB_URI= " URL of the cloud database setup on MongoAtlas "

api_secret= " credentials of cloudinary "
api_key= " credentials of cloudinary "
cloud_name= " credentials of cloudinary "

REDIS_HOST = "get from redis cloud" ,
REDIS_PORT = "get from redis cloud" ,
REDIS_PASSWORD = "get from redis cloud",
```
### Starting the project locally
#### in app/client, below starts the client-side React+Vite application
```
npm run build
npm run prod
```
#### in app/server, below starts the server-side Node+Express application
```
npm run dev
```
